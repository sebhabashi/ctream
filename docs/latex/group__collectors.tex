\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classctream_1_1collectors_1_1Collector}{Collector}}$<$T = \{input type\}, A = \{accumulator type\}, R = \{result type\}$>$}

Collectors are objects that contain information on how to export the data from the streams into usable output data. Their aim is to have a simple syntax, and to be parallelized easily.

The logic behind collectors is to {\ttfamily accumulate()} the elements of type T of the stream in to partial results of type A. These partial results are then combined into a complete result of type A with function {\ttfamily combine()}. This complete result is finally converted into the final output result of type R by function {\ttfamily finish()}.

Using a different type for A and R is not always necessary, but it can sometimes be very useful. For instance, to concatenate strings, a solution to avoid copying strings endlessly (the one used in this library) is to use stringstream objects as accumulators, and then finish by extracting the string from the stringstream.
